# ISBN-Downloader

I fr am too lazy to manually take things from libgen, so I am automating it. But also like if it does not have the isbn I might have to actually buy the textbook

- Made using the rust API package from libgen, vandy fr dont ban hammer me for this
  
# To Use:

```
cd isbn-downloader
cargo run
```
